# Harmoniser (Jacob Collier / Ben Bloomberg)

Recreation of Jacob Collier's harmonizer created by creative technologist Ben Bloomberg.
Ben's actual creation is more sophisticated while this was a project I pieced together in one very late night. I focused on simplicity but future iterations would perhaps increase quality of sound.

## Demo



## Getting Started
Easiest way is to just install from pip. The installation should be cross platform.
```
pip install harmoniser
```
Then 
```
$ harmoniser
```
